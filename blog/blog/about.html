                <p class="aboutMeText">I am a software engineer with a passion for learning and sharing knowledge. I
                    enjoy
                    exploring new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.

                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p class="aboutMeText">

                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
                    to
                    create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutMeText">
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                    about
                    my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>

                <p class="aboutMeText">
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                    learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but
                    also
                    write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutMeText">
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                    helping others learn and stay motivated.
