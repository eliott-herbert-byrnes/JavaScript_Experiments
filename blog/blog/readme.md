# üìù My Learning Journal (Vanilla JS Blog Project)

Welcome to **My Learning Journal** ‚Äî a fully responsive, mobile-first blog built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This project is part of my self-directed web development journey, where I focused on building a scalable, modular blog architecture without frameworks, to deeply understand how multi-page web applications work from the ground up.
